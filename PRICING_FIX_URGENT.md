## What You Should Charge

### MINIMUM (Just to Break Even)
**R10,800/month**

### RECOMMENDED (Sustainable + Small Profit)
**R12,000/month** ✅
- Covers all costs: R10,758
- Small profit margin: R1,242
- Still cheaper than ownership for client in Year 1

### PREMIUM (If They Value Full Service)
**R15,000/month**
- Covers costs + decent profit
- Justified by all-inclusive service
- Priority support included

## Update Your Contract Documents

### Change This:
```
Monthly License: R6,500/month
```

### To This:
```
Monthly License: R12,000/month
```

### Updated License-to-Own:
```
Monthly Fee: R12,000 (R4,000/month credit toward ownership)
Setup Fee: R15,000 (R10,000 credit toward ownership)

After 18 months:
- Total paid: R15k + (R12k × 18) = R231k
- Credits earned: R10k + (R4k × 18) = R82k
- Final payment to own: R21k
```
